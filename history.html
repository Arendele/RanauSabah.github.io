            <h3>Mamut Copper Mine in Ranau</h3>
            <p class="story">Ranau, Sabah has a rich history that dates back many years. The area was originally inhabited by the indigenous Dusun people, who lived in harmony with the surrounding natural environment. The Dusun people had a deep connection with the land and relied on agriculture for their livelihoods.</p>

The British recognized the strategic importance of the region and established a presence in Ranau. They introduced new systems of governance, infrastructure development, and economic activities.</P>

            <figcaption><b>A sign board marking the "POW Route"</figcaption></b>
            <p>During World War II, Ranau played a significant role in the infamous Sandakan Death Marches. In 1945, the Japanese Imperial Army forced around 2,400 Allied prisoners of war(POW) to march from Sandakan to Ranau. The march was grueling and brutal, resulting in the death of the majority of prisoners due to exhaustion, malnutrition, and mistreatment. Today, the Kundasang War Memorial stands as a solemn tribute to the fallen soldiers who endured immense suffering during this dark period of history. </p>
