            <h2>HINAVA</h2>
            <p>Hinava is a traditional dish from the Malaysian state of Sabah, specifically associated with the Kadazan-Dusun ethnic group. It is a simple and flavorful seafood salad made from fresh raw fish, typically mackerel or pomfret, which is marinated in lime juice. The acidity of the lime juice "cooks" the fish, giving it a slightly firm texture and a tangy taste. The marinated fish is then mixed with sliced onions, chili peppers, ginger, and sometimes grated coconut. The combination of these ingredients creates a refreshing and zesty flavor profile. Hinava is often served as an appetizer or side dish and is popular during festive occasions and cultural celebrations in Sabah. Its simplicity and use of fresh ingredients make it a beloved and cherished dish among locals and visitors alike</p>

            <h2>LINOPOT</h2>
            <p> It is a flavorful and hearty meal that consists of layers of rice, meat, and various ingredients, all cooked together in a bamboo tube. To prepare linopot, the bamboo tube is first lined with banana leaves to prevent the ingredients from sticking. Then, a layer of rice is added followed by a layer of marinated meat, usually chicken or beef. Other ingredients such as sliced vegetables, herbs, and spices are added to enhance the flavors. The bamboo tube is then sealed with banana leaves and cooked over an open fire or charcoal, allowing the steam to cook the ingredients inside. This cooking method imparts a distinct smoky aroma and infuses the dish with flavors from the bamboo. Once cooked, the linopot is carefully opened, revealing the layers of rice and tender meat. It is typically served hot and enjoyed as a communal meal, with everyone digging into the bamboo tube to savor the delicious combination of flavors and textures. Linopot is not only a tasty dish but also a symbol of the traditional culinary heritage of Ranau, reflecting the harmony between nature and the local community's culinary creativity.</p>
